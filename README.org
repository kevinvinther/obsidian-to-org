#+title: Obsidian to Org

This small script allows you to convert an entire Obsidian (or any other markdown-centered) directory to an org-roam centered directory.

** Usage
#+begin_src python
python main.py [-h] [--math] input_folder output_folder
#+end_src
The files in the input folder will be converted and put in the output folder. I would advise against making the input folder your Obsidian vault, instead of making a copy which you just delete after the program has run. The converted files will all be put in the output folder.
The =--math= flag adds =#+PROPERTY: latexpreview= to all the converted files, such that they automatically preview Latex equations.

** Todo
- Implement tags properly
  - Currently the tags don't convert to anything.
